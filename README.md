## [![Yank](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knowm/Yank/develop/etc/Yank_64_64.png)](http://knowm.org/open-source/yank/) Yank
Ultra-Light JDBC Persistance Layer for Java Apps

## In a Nutshell

Never deal with the monotony and pitfalls of handling JDBC ResultSets and Connections again. Yank deals with connection pooling and table row to Java object mapping for you so you don't have to worry about it.

## Long Description

Yank is a very easy-to-use yet flexible SQL-centric persistence layer for JDBC-compatible databases build on top of org.apache.DBUtils. Yank is a different approach to the over-ORMing of Java persistence.
Rather than try to abstract away the SQL underneath, Yank assumes you want low level control over the SQL queries you execute. Yank is one level higher than raw JDBC code with minimal frills. Yank wraps DBUtils,
hiding the nitty-gritty Connection and ResultSet handling behind a straight-forward proxy class: `Yank`. "Query" methods execute SELECT statements and return POJOs or a List of POJOs. "Execute"
methods execute INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE (and other) statements. Recently, annotation-based column-field mapping, batch executing, column list querying and scalar querying has been added. Since version 3.0.0, Yank uses the
[Hikari connection pool](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP) as its integrated connection pool.

## Basic Example

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {

  // Connection Pool Properties
  Properties dbProps = new Properties();
  dbProps.setProperty("jdbcUrl", "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/Yank");
  dbProps.setProperty("username", "root");
  dbProps.setProperty("password", "");

  // setup connection pool
  Yank.setupDefaultConnectionPool(dbProps);

  // query book
  String sql = "SELECT * FROM BOOKS WHERE TITLE = ?";
  Object[] params = new Object[] { "Cryptonomicon" };
  Book book = Yank.queryBean(sql, Book.class, params);
  System.out.println(book.toString());

  // release connection pool
  Yank.releaseDefaultConnectionPool();
}
```

## Connection Pool Configuration

Yank comes bundled with the Hikari Connection Pool. When you setup Yank using the `Yank.setupDefaultConnectionPool` method and pass it a `Properties` object, that object must at the very least contain `jdbcUrl`, `username` and `password` properties. Another common property is `maximumPoolSize`.To see a full list of available configuration properties along with their defaults, see [Hikari's main README](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP).

## Hide Those Properties Away!

```java
// Connection Pool Properties
Properties dbProps = PropertiesUtils.getPropertiesFromClasspath("MYSQL_DB.properties");

// setup data source
Yank.setupDefaultConnectionPool(dbProps);
```
Why? Hardcoding properties is fine for something quick and dirty, but loading them from a file is generally more convenient and flexible. For example, you may have separate properties for unit tests, development and production deployments. BTW, you can load them from a path too with: `PropertiesUtils.getPropertiesFromPath(String fileName)`. At the bare minimum, you need to provide `username`, `password`, and `jdbcUrl` configuration properties.

## Hide Those SQL Statements Away!

```java
// SQL Statements in Properties file
Properties sqlProps = PropertiesUtils.getPropertiesFromClasspath("MYSQL_SQL.properties");
Yank.addSQLStatements(sqlProps);
// ...
String sqlKey = "BOOKS_CREATE_TABLE";
Yank.executeSQLKey(sqlKey, null);
```
Why? Sometimes it's nice to have all your SQL statements in one place. As an example see: [MYSQL_SQL.properties](https://github.com/knowm/Yank/blob/develop/src/test/resources/MYSQL_SQL.properties). Also this allows you to swap databases easily without changing any code. Keep one for database type `X` and one for database type `Y`. BTW, to access the actual statements in the  properties file, you use the `Yank.*SQLKey(...)` methods in `Yank`. You can also add multiple properties files and they will be merged! If the SQL statement cannot be found, a `SQLStatementNotFoundException` runtime exception is thrown.

## Stay Organized! You Will Thank Yourself Later.
```java
public class Book {

  private String title;
  private String author;
  private double price;
  
    // default constructor

  // getters and setters
}
```
```java

public class BooksDAO {

  public static int insertBook(Book book) {

    Object[] params = new Object[] { book.getTitle(), book.getAuthor(), book.getPrice() };
    String SQL = "INSERT INTO BOOKS  (TITLE, AUTHOR, PRICE) VALUES (?, ?, ?)";
    return Yank.execute(SQL, params);
  }

  // ...

  public static List<Book> selectAllBooks() {

    String SQL = "SELECT * FROM BOOKS";
    return Yank.queryBeanList(SQL, Book.class, null);
  }
}
```
Why? By creating a DAO class and putting all methods related to a single database table in it, you have a single point of access to that table. In this example the **BooksDAO** corresponds to a table called **Books**, which contains rows of **Book** objects (a.k.a beans). Note that your beans **must** have the default, no args constructor.

## Annotate Class Fields
```java
public static class Book {

  private int id;
  @Column("TITEL")
  private String title;
  @Column("AUTOR")
  private String author;
  @Column("PREIS")
  private double price;
  
  // default constructor

  // getters and setters
}
```
The default automatic mapping from database row to Java objects happens when the object's field names match the table column names (not case-sensitive). Automatic snake case (my_column_name) to camel case (myColumnName) mapping is supported too. If that still isn't good enough, you can annotate the Java object's fields with a `Column` annotation.

## Insert and Receive the Assigned ID
```java
Object[] params = new Object[] { book.getTitle(), book.getAuthorName(), book.getPrice() };
String SQL = "INSERT INTO BOOKS (TITLE, AUTHOR, PRICE) VALUES (?, ?, ?)";
Long id = Yank.insert(SQL, params);
```
With a special `Yank.insert(...)` method, Yank will return the assigned auto-increment primary key ID. Note that you can alternatively use the `Yank.execute(...)` method for inserts, which returns the number of affected rows.

## Retrieve a Column as a List
```java
String SQL = "SELECT TITLE FROM BOOKS";
String columnName = "title";
List<String> bookTitles = Yank.queryColumnList(SQL, columnName, String.class, null);
```
With the `Yank.queryColumnList(...)` method you can retrieve a List containing objects matching column data type.

## Query a Scalar Value
```java
String SQL = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BOOKS";
long numBooks = Yank.querySingleScalar(SQL, Long.class, null);
```
With the `Yank.querySingleScalar(...)` method you can retrieve a single scalar value that matches the return type of the given SQL statement.
## Life's a Batch
```java
List<Book> books = new ArrayList<Book>();
// add books to list

Object[][] params = new Object[books.size()][];

for (int i = 0; i < books.size(); i++) {
  Book book = books.get(i);
  params[i] = new Object[] { book.getTitle(), book.getAuthor(), book.getPrice() };
}

String SQL = "INSERT INTO BOOKS (TITLE, AUTHOR, PRICE) VALUES (?, ?, ?)";
int numInsertedRows = Yank.executeBatch(SQL, params);
```

## Handle Exceptions

By default Yank catches each `SQLException`, wraps them in a `YankSQLException` and logs them as error logs using the `slf4J` logging framework. If you want to change the behavior so that the `YankSQLException`s are instead rethrown, just call `Yank.setThrowWrappedExceptions(true);`. If you want direct access to the `SQLException`, simply call the `getSqlException()` method. Here's an example:

```java
Yank.setThrowWrappedExceptions(true);

Object[] params = new Object[] { book.getTitle(), book.getAuthor(), book.getPrice() };
String SQL = "INSERT INTO BOOKS (TITLE, AUT_HOR, PRICE) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)";
try {
  Yank.execute(SQL, params);
} catch (YankSQLException e) {
  e.printStackTrace();
SQLException sqlException = e.getSqlException();
}
```

```java
org.knowm.yank.exceptions.YankSQLException: Error in SQL query!!!; row column count mismatch Query: INSERT INTO BOOKS (TITLE, AUT_HOR, PRICE) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?) Parameters: [Cryptonomicon, Neal Stephenson, 23.99]; Pool Name= yank-default; SQL= INSERT INTO BOOKS (TITLE, AUT_HOR, PRICE) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
...
```


## Summary

Whether or not your app is a tiny script, a large webapp, or anything in between the main pattern to follow is the same:

1. Configure a connection pool: `Yank.setupDefaultConnectionPool(dbProps);`
1. Use Yank's methods: `Yank.execute(...) `,`Yank.executeBatch(...) `, `Yank.insert(...) `, `Yank.queryColumn(...) `, `Yank.queryObjectArrays(...) `, `Yank.queryBeanList(...) `, `Yank.queryBean(...) `, `Yank.queryScalar(...) `
1. Release the connection pool: ` Yank.releaseDefaultConnectionPool();`

For an example of Yank in action in a `DropWizard` web application see [XDropWizard](https://github.com/knowm/XDropWizard).

Now go ahead and [study some more examples](http://knowm.org/open-source/yank/yank-example-code), [download the thing](http://knowm.org/open-source/yank/yank-change-log/) and [provide feedback](https://github.com/knowm/Yank/issues).

## Caveats

Yank was designed to be ultra-light and ultra-convenient and is philosophically different than most other competing libraries. Some "sacrifices" were made to stick to this design.

 * No multi-statement transaction service (This may be just fine for small to medium projects or to back a REST web application's API: POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively.)
 * Checked SQLExceptions are wrapped into unchecked `YankSQLException`s (SQL Exceptions are internally caught and wrapped. This is a heavily debated topic and many differing opinions exist. Yank, being ultra-light, catches and logs or rethrows YankSQLExceptions.)
 * A Hikari connection pool is used behind the scenes (Generic DataSource integration isn't supported. If you just want a connection pool that works and don't care about the specific implementation this point is irrelevant.)

For many cases, the above features are not necessary, but that's for you to determine. If you are developing a critical banking application, you will probably need those features. For other applications where 100% data integrity isn't critical (such as [bitcoinium.com](https://bitcoinium.com/) for example), Yank's simplicity may be attractive. In return for the sacrifices, you write less code and your code will be cleaner. Additionally, since `Yank`'s methods are `public static`, you can access it from anywhere in your application and not have to worry about passing around a reference to it. If you need those missing features, check out these projects similar to Yank: [sql2o](http://www.sql2o.org/) and [JDBI](http://jdbi.org/).
